The &#x1C0;Xam name for the planet Jupiter was <q><span lang="xam">Gaue &#x1C0;&#x1EBD;</span></q>, which translates as <q>Dawn's Heart</q>. In this story, he was married to a caracal (lynx).</p>
<p class="siitshoanntshoo uua">Once upon a time, Dawn's Heart hid his little daughter in a safe place in a pile of roots. There his wife, the female Lynx, would be able to find and suckle it. The father said to his daughter: <q>You will recognize your mother by her beautiful jewellery and by her two magnificent karosses that she wears. She will come accompanied by her little sister. Both have bright faces and reddish bodies.</q></p><picture><source media="(max-width:700px)" srcset="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Jupiter_%2894022019%29.jpeg/320px-Jupiter_%2894022019%29.jpeg"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Jupiter_%2894022019%29.jpeg/640px-Jupiter_%2894022019%29.jpeg" class="oqhbar" alt="Planet Jupiter" title="Dawn's Heart in the night sky.

<p class="siitshoanntshoo">The child obeyed her father. Both Jackal and Hyena came by and tried to persuade the daughter to go with them. But she refused and remained in her hiding place, because she knew that these two could be hatching a mean plot. But when she heard the clinking jewelry of her approaching mother, the Lynx, she jumped out of her hiding place and climbed on top of her mother's back. And so Lynx, together with her younger sister and her daughter, went out to gather food, because they had long been hungry. After they had finished gathering, they came back home and prepared the food together.</p>
<p class="siitshoanntshoo">Hyena, still angry because the child did not want to go with her before, came and offered them <span lang="xam">&#x1C1;xe</span> (a certain kind of ant's chrysalids). Lynx cooked them along with the rest of the food. But in her wickedness, Hyena secretly put her own putrid armpit sweat into the food. As soon as Lynx had tasted the food prepared in this way, the hyena's sweat started to show its devastating effect. Lynx jumped around wildly. Her beautiful jewellery fell off her and spread around on the floor. She ran away into the reeds next to the path. After calming down a bit, she realized what Hyena had done to her: Slowly, Lynx began to turn into a beast!</p> 
<p class="siitshoanntshoo">And Hyena? She picked up Lynx's jewellery and put it on herself to wear. Unnoticed, she sneaked into the hut where Dawn's Heart lived with his wife.</p>
<p class="siitshoanntshoo">Lynx's younger sister was still carrying the little child with her. She followed Lynx until she found her in the reeds and said: <q>My dear sister, your daughter is hungry. Please feed her with your milk. ... Wait, what do you look like? What is happening to you?</q>. Only now did she see that Lynx was beginning to transform into something else. Lynx answered her: <q>My little sister, I feel that I am starting to transform into something else. I am feeling unwell. A long, shaggy fur is growing on my skin. I am starting to lose my MIIINNNND. ... Hold on. I am going to give my daughter some of my milk to drink.</q> Lynx crawled out of the reeds. With great effort, she still managed to suckle her daughter. She then said: <q>My dear sister, I am slowly turning into a beast. Soon I will have completely forgotten who I am. I can not return home anymore. I must stay here in the reeds. Do not tell anybody that I am hidden here. Please bring my daughter to me every day for the next few days. As longe as I still can, I will continue to suckle her so that she can become healthy and strong.</q><picture><source media="(max-width:700px)" srcset="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Caracal_kitten.jpg/160px-Caracal_kitten.jpg"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Caracal_kitten.jpg/320px-Caracal_kitten.jpg" class="oqhbal chuantshoe" alt="a Caracal kitten" title="A Caracal kitten.

<p class="siitshoanntshoo">The younger sister did as she was told. Each day she brought Lynx's daughter to her hiding spot in the reeds. Each day Lynx was transformed a little further. Each day it became more difficult and agonizing to suckle the little child. It took only a few days, then the transformation had progressed so far that it was hardly recognizable that the beast here in the reeds was once a graceful lynx, the wife of Dawn's Heart. She was now almost completely transformed into a beast. With her last bit of intellectMIIINNNND and great effort, she spoke to her sister: <q>Just look at me. Soon I will be completely transformed. My mind is almost completely gone. I am now a danger to my own child and to you. Don't come to me anymore! Leave me here and stay away from me!</q></p>
<p class="siitshoanntshoo">What did Hyena do on that day? As on the days before, she remained hidden in the hut where Dawn's Heart lived with his wife, the Lynx. Since Hyena hid in the hut, she pretended to be Dawn's Heart's wife, the Lynx. With Lynx's jewellery, Hyena looked almost like Lynx before her transformation. Because the otherwise so boorish Hyena now showed her finest behaviour, she was not recognizable as Hyena. And because she had applied Lynx's perfume on herself, Dawn's Heart was not even able to recognize Hyena by her foul stench. Hyena's camouflage worked!</p>
<p class="siitshoanntshoo">Today, dawn's heart was outside all day to hunt. finally, hyena could afford to take off Lynx's heavy, clinking jewellery. Quiet as a mouse, she remained seated in the hut so that she would not attract any attention.</p>
<p class="siitshoanntshoo">In the evening, when Dawn's Heart returned from hunting, a dance was held. Everyone participated, except Hyena, who thought nothing of dancing an remained holed up in the hut. As promised, Lynx's younger sister had not yet told anyone about Lynx's terrible transformation. Dawn's Heart spoke to her and told her that his wife, with whom he shares his hut, behaved differently than usual. Thereupon, Lynx's sister scolded him loudly: <q>What? You are sharing your hut with a hyena and do not even realize that this is a hyena and not your wife?</q> She told him about the terrible transformation of his wife, the Lynx. Dawn's Heart was angry: Why didn't his sister-in-law tell him earlier? But he was even angrier at Hyena. He was so furious that his eyes started to glow violently with anger. Ever since, the planet Jupiter has shone so bright that it still glows brightly in the sky at dawn, when the remaining stars are no longer visible. He entered his hut and attacked Hyena with his throwing spear. She jumped out of the hut so quickly that she could not see where she was jumping and ended up????? in the campfire with her paws. Ever since, all hyenas have had black paws. Hyena trotted away and fled.</p>
<p class="siitshoanntshoo">As soon as the next morning dawned, they made their way to the place where the transformed Lynx was hiding. Lynx's sister walked ahead and carried the child on her back. Dawn's Heart followed her. Some people went with them for safety. And they  took a few goats with them to lure Lynx, who was now a savage beast. Having arrived at the place, the sister called for Lynx. From the reeds, the fearsome beast jumped out wildly. As expected, she immediately pounced on one of the goats and half-ate it. Her sister and husband seized the opportunity to catch the shaggy beast. They rubbed her with the blood from the goat's stomach and forced her to smell the sweat of all her closest family members. By this, she remembered again who she actually is. They rubbed and plucked out the animal hair that had grown on her. Lynx said: <q>Please leave the tufts of hair on my ears, otherwise I will not be able to hear well</q>. Ever since, all lynxes have tufts of hair on their ear tips. But apart from that, she became the normal Lynx again just like before. Why Dawn's Heart was hiding his daughter in the first place, and how the two became stars in the sky, was unfortunately not handed down to us.</p>

<p>&#x1C0;Xam were a group of hunter-gatherers in western parts of South Africa, in today's Northern Cape Province. From 18th century on, many thousand of them were killed by colonizers. By the beginning of the 20th century, so few people were left that their cultural knowledge and their language died out. In the decades before, the linguist Wilhelm Bleek, his assistant Lucy Lloyd und later his daughter Dorothea Bleek still collected several thousand pages of text from their stories, myths and folklore. </p></details>
