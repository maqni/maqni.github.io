Markus Riedel â€“ a small e-visiting card. 
The files and html/css codes for my personal website.


**About this project**

This project contains the files for a personal website. His website is available in a <a href="https://maqni.github.io/de/index.html">German version</a> and in an <a href="https://maqni.github.io/en/index.html">English version</a>.

The website's code attempts to use good practice in layouting the website, for example by trying to use the more modern html tags such as the structuring &lt;section&gt;, &lt;header&gt; and so on properly and avoiding ominous html tags such as &lt;br&gt;. The website avoids using JavaScript and tries to be as simple as possible. It also tries for best practice in accessibility (e.g. being understandable for screenreaders) and responsiveness (accessing the website from a PC or from a phone, high or low resolution). 

As written above, this website projects tries these things, but it should be seen as a beginner's project which is still far from perfect. For beginners learning to code in html, the source code provided here may be of interest and help in writing an own html website.
